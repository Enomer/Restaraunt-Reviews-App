#### _Restaurant Reviews Web App_

## Project Overview

For this **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. I took a static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for my users.

### How to run

Used python backend, just install python
```python python -m http.server 5000 ```
open http://localhost:5000

### Features

Implemented the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
Wrote code to implement the updates to get the site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code.
